Introduce yourself in this file!

Tell us your name, year, school, major (if you are undecided, write down the frontrunners), and a fun fact!

My name is Jason Zhang and I am a first year in LSA. I am undecided about my major but it will probably either be data science or computer science. I can solve a 3x3 rubik's cube in around 30 seconds.
